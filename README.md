# What is this about

- Where I'm learning C, with a focus on the operating system context

## Current Projects

- Subfolders that I'm learning and doing projects on:

1. Hello World! - as the name suggests
2. Linux Shell Simulation - using fork() and execvp() to create an environment such as the Linux Shell, taking user input, then displaying output
3. Pipe Simulation - demonstrates how to use pipes for communication between a parent process and a child process
4. CPU Scheduling - calculating the average waiting time of FCFS and RR based on a list of inputs
